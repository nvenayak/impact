Quick Install
**********************************
Download a `Python 3 installation <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ for your platform, 
or you can use `Anaconda <https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_. Anaconda has many of the dependencies pre-installed,
and is an easy option to get off the ground quickly. 

Fresh environments can be quickly spun up using the requirements.txt

	pip install -r requirements.txt

Optionally you can install the requirements for different modules as needed using the specific requirements_*.txt files

You can install the package in two ways:

1.	'python setup.py install' which will install into your site-packages directory, 
2.	'python setup.py develop' which will install into your current directory.
